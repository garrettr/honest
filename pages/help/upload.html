title: Upload | Help

Before you share files with us, it is important to take a few steps to protect yourself. Our goal is to make the process of submitting files as easy as possible, even for non-technical users, while remaining highly secure.

This is the basic set of instructions for uploading files. Users with some technical background may be interested in the advanced set, which has suggestions for additional steps you can take.

Basic Instructions
====================

Background
----------

If you tried to visit the Upload page earlier, you may have seen a warning message about not using Tor. Tor is free, open-source software that is widely used by activists around the world to browse the web anonymously.

We've designed our access page so that it can *only* be accessed through the Tor network. Therefore, you will need to download and run Tor to upload files to us. The easiest way to do this is to download and run a Tor Browser Bundle. This is a special verison of the Firefox web browser configured to route your traffic through the Tor anonymizing network. 

Get Tor
-------

To get the Tor bundle, visit the [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en) and download the appropriate browser bundle for you platform. Extract the file and run the Tor Browser program. It will automatically connect to the Tor network (this may take a minute), and then launch a modified verision of the Firefox web browser (it may be named Aurora) that is configured to use the new Tor connection.

### Having trouble?

For more detailed instructions on the Tor Browser Bundle, including a step-by-step video and notes on usage on different platforms, [see here](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en). 

Prepare your files
------------------

Our upload page only accepts a limited subset of filetypes for security purposes. Here's a list of the filetypes we currently accept, and their file extensions:

1.  PDF: .pdf
2.  Microsoft Word: .doc, .docx
3.  Microsoft Excel: .xls, .xlsx
4.  Microsoft Powerpoint: .ppt, .pptx
5.  Plain text: .txt
6.  Zip archives: .zip
6.  7zip archives: .7zip

We have an upload limit of 100MB per file. If you files are larger than 100MB, try compressing them or splitting them with a tool such as RAR.

If you attempt to upload files that do not adhere to these guidelines, you will receive an error message and the upload will be cancelled.

Upload your files
-----------------

Once you're running Tor successfully and you've prepared your files for upload, use the Tor Browser to visit our upload page here:

    https://www.honestappalachia.org/upload

The website will check if you're successfully using Tor, and, if so, it will redirect to our secure upload page.

The secure upload page is very simple. Click "Choose File..." to select the file you wish to upload. You may optionally include a comment with information about the files to help us source and analyze them. Do not include any personally identifying information in this comment.

Click "Upload" and wait for the upload to complete. This may take several minutes to complete, depending on the size of the file. *Do not interrupt the upload*, for example by clicking the Back button in your browser. When the upload has finished, it will display a confirmation message.
