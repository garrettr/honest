Our current development is supported by a generous grant from the [Sunlight Foundation][1], a Washington D.C.-based group that develops digital tools to empower citizens to hold their governments accountable. 

Maintaining a secure website incurs a lot of costs – for servers to host our websites, SSL certificates to encrypt Internet communications, and more. At the moment, the top item on our wishlist is money to pay for more and better-situated servers, which would allow us to make Honest Appalachia a more secure and reliable platform for protecting the anonymity of its users.

If you would like to support the project, please consider donating! At the moment, we accept donations via Paypal. Click the button below to donate to us securely – you can use your Paypal account or a credit/debit card.
